# CPP-Neural-Net
CPP-Neural-Net is an educational C++ project designed to understand the inner workings of neural networks by building one from the ground up. This project serves as a hands-on introduction to machine learning concepts, providing insight into how neural networks function behind the scenes without relying on external machine learning libraries.
